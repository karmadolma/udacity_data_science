###  Project 1 : AI, A Developer's Best Friend in the Digital Age
The data for this analysis is based on the survey taken by Stack Overflow in 2023. More than 90,000 developers responded to survey on varying questions ranging from their learning preference, kind of programming languange they work on day-to-day basis as well as tools and preferences for AI tools. This analysis does not definitively explain how the market behaves in relation to software development but provides a general insight into the prevailing trends and patterns.

#### Library used 
The following are the library that has been used
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- FuncFormatter from matplotlib.ticker

#### File Description 
There are three files in total saved under this repository:
- AI, A Developer's Best Friend in the Digital Age.ipynb : This is the jupyter notebook which contains all the code that was created for analysing the data.
- so_survey_2023.pdf: This file contains all the questions that were part of the survey 2023.
- survey_results_schema.csv: This file contains the schema of the data in survey_results_public.csv.
- survey_results_public.csv.zip: This file contains all the responses collected from the survey.

#### Project Motivation 
Given the growing influence of AI in many fields, I aimed to explore software developers' views on AI advancements, their motivations for using AI, and the most popular AI tools they employ.

#### Link to Blog 
This analysis has also been published as a blog in medium which you can find [here] (https://medium.com/@karmadolma.grg/ai-a-developers-best-friend-in-the-digital-age-376f7e6b058e).
